### Hi, everyone. 
This is my third attempt to create a bot for games.
This time it's Lordz.io
The bot is simple and its job is to find and collect coins.



### Problems to fix:
- Avoiding obstacles ta other players
- Going off the map

### How to run
Open the game

The game should be in the upper left corner and have a size of 800px x 640px
```python
install all requirements
python main.py
```

Thank you all, have fun playing!
